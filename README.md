# Module Three final project

There are 2 options for the Module-3 final project:

1. Implement the provided Solar System Geeks online store application described below.
2. Design and implement your own custom front-end application utilizing your module-2 final project.

If a custom application was completed for the Module-3 mid-module project, that project can be extended and built upon for the Module-3 final project.

## Design Requirements

All applications must be accompanied by project design documents, wireframes, mockups, and/or diagrams.
 * Required design documents must be submitted along with the source code in the `client/design` folder.
 * Recommended design documents are optional.

### Required

* [**Custom project only**] Documentation of functional requirements to act as the application's Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)).
  * A functional requirement describes what the application can do or provide from a user's perspective.
  * Functional requirements can be encapsulated into a *[user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)*. For example,
    * "As an authenticated user, I can click the "Cart" link on the navigation bar to visit my shopping cart."
    * "As an anonymous or authenticated user, on the Products page, I can view the product list as a tiled view or a table view, by clicking the appropriate icon."
* [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-wireframing/)
  * Show the **basic** page layout
    * Header, footer, main content area, navigation, headings, whitespace/padding
    * Indicate interactive elements
      * Buttons, links, forms, dropdown menus, pop-ups ([modal](https://www.digitalsilk.com/digital-trends/modal-in-web-design/)), switches
    * Placeholder images
    * Mock text and mock data
  * Indicate the transitions between pages
  * A separate wireframe for every page view in your application
  * A separate wireframe for mobile and desktop page views
    * Desktop view is 1024 pixel width or greater
    * Mobile view is 425 pixel width or smaller
  * Can be created by hand or digitally using an online tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
    * Here are some [examples](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/learning/handbooks/agile-handbook/wireframe.jsp) of wireframes
    * Place your wireframes in the `client/design` folder


### Recommended

* Choose a color scheme for your site
  * example: https://coolors.co/
* Choose Typography
  * example: https://fonts.google.com/
* Choose icons
  * example: https://fontawesome.com/

## Creating or Extending your own Application

### Custom Project Requirements

The following are the minimum requirements your application must include:

* Documentation of at least **7 functional requirements**
  * Must requirements must reference at least two users: an anonymous user and an authenticated user
    * Anonymous user: a person who hasn't yet logged into the application
    * Authenticated user: a person who has registered with and logged into the application
  * At least 3 requirements must include an authenticated user
  * The 3 provided login, logout, and registration requirements **can not** be included as a part of the 7 functional requirements

  * A front-end web application using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript is **not** acceptable
* Must include at least 3 pages (views)
  * Must use Vue Router to transition between the pages (views)
  * The provided login, logout, and registration pages **can not** count towards the 3 pages
* Must implement the 3 functional requirements for user registration, login, and logout listed below
* Must consume a REST API hosted by a web server created using Spring Boot and Postgres either created by the student or provided by your instructor
  * This will be the module-2 final project unless an exception is granted by your instructor
  * The application must enable users to either create, update, or delete data in the database through the REST API
  * The application must dynamically display at least 5 JavaScript objects from an array obtained from the REST API
    * **Hard-coding data in a JavaScript array/object or in the HTML section is not permitted**
* Styling that utilizes CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid
  * You may use other CSS libraries (bootstrap, tailwind, etc.) to *supplement* your CSS styling
* No horizontal (left or right) scrolling of the page in the browser window
* Support for both desktop and mobile views
  * Desktop view is 1024 pixel width or greater
  * Mobile view is 425 pixel width or smaller
* At least 5 custom event listeners and event handlers that respond to user input
  * An event listener for `DOMContentLoaded` can not be used as one of the 5 event listeners
* A clear purpose, function, or utility

#### Registration and login functional requirements
The following 3 functional reaquirements **must** be implemented for all custom projects.

* As an anonymous user, I can register a new account
  * This feature already exists—**you just need to style the registration page**
* As an anonymous user, I can login using an existing username and password
  * This feature already exists in the starter code—**you just need to style the login page**
* As an authenticated user, I can click "Logout" to logout of the application
  * After logout, the system redirects me to the Login page
  * This feature already exists in the starter code


## Starter Code

### Server setup

Begin by opening the Module Two final project in IntelliJ and reviewing the code. Go to `src/main/resources/application.properties` of your Java project and confirm that the `server.port` setting has the value of 9000:

```conf
server.port=9000
```

For **every controller class** in the `controller` package, add the `@CrossOrigin` annotation above the class definition

```java
@CrossOrigin  // <-- add to each controller class
@RestController
public class AuthenticationController {
```

### Front-end setup

Open the `client` folder in Visual Studio Code.

Take a moment to review the `.env` file that's located in the root of the project. You can store environment variables that you want to use throughout your application in this file. When you open it, you'll see a variable that stores the URL of the API provided by the Module Two final project:
​
```conf
# Java
VITE_REMOTE_API=http://localhost:9000
```

*Note:* As you previously confirmed, the Java Spring Boot application runs on port 9000 instead of 8080.

Open a terminal window and download any dependencies by running this command:
​
```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start your Vue application with the following command:
​
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Authentication
​
When you first run the project and visit the base URL, you're taken to the home page. If you look in `src/router/index.js`, you'll see that the route objects contain a `meta` object containing `requiresAuth`.
* If the value of `requiresAuth` is true, then that route can only be accessed after a successful user login.
* If the value of `requiresAuth` is false, then login is not required.

```js
{
  path: '/',
  name: 'home',
  component: HomeView,
  meta: {
    requiresAuth: true
  }
},
{
  path: "/login",
  name: "login",
  component: LoginView,
  meta: {
    requiresAuth: false
  }
},
```

You'll also see the following code, which prevents any **anonymous user** from visiting certain routes. An anonymous user is someone who hasn't logged in to the site and therefore doesn't have a token.

This code ensures that when such a user attempts to visit a route that requires authentication, the router instead directs them to the login page:
​
```js
router.beforeEach((to) => {

  // Get the Vuex store
  const store = useStore();

  // Determine if the route requires Authentication
  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some(x => x.meta.requiresAuth);

  // If it does and they are not logged in, send the user to "/login"
  if (requiresAuth && store.state.token === '') {
    return {name: "login"};
  }
  // Otherwise, do nothing and they'll go to their next destination
});
```

### AuthService
​
In the `services/AuthService.js` file you'll notice there is no `axios.create()` method call.

```js
import axios from 'axios';
​
// axios.create() not needed, baseURL set in src/main.js

export default {
​
  login(user) {
    return http.post('/login', user)
  },

  register(user) {
    return http.post('/register', user)
  }
​
}
```

The axios baseURL is set globally for all axios calls by default in `src/main.js` using the `VITE_REMOTE_API` environment variable set in the `.env` file.

```conf
// .env
VITE_REMOTE_API=http://localhost:9000
```

```js
// src/main.js
axios.defaults.baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_REMOTE_API;
```

### Vuex
​
The state for this application is stored in `src/store/index.js` using Vuex. The state object has two values: `token` and `user`. When you log in, the back-end service returns an authentication token along with your user credentials.
​
The authentication token is sent in the `Authorization` header to verify your identify. To persist this token when the application is closed or the page is refreshed, you'll store the token in local storage.
​
The default token either comes from local storage or it's set to an empty string. As you learned in the previous section, if the route requires authentication and this token is empty, it redirects the user to the login page:
​
```js
// src/main.js
const currentToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
if (currentToken) {
  // Set token axios requests
  axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${currentToken}`;
}
​
// src/store/index.js
export function createStore(currentToken, currentUser) {
  let store = _createStore({
    state: {
      token: currentToken || '',
      user: currentUser || {}
    },
    // ...
  });
}
```

### Login

When you call the `SET_AUTH_TOKEN` mutation, several things happen.
​
First, you set the `state.token` value to what's returned from the API's `/login` method. Next, you store that same value in local storage so that it persists across refreshes. Finally, you set the `Authorization` header in Axios so that every subsequent request contains the token. This way, you don't have to manually do this on every request:
​
```js
mutations: {
  SET_AUTH_TOKEN(state, token) {
    state.token = token;
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
}
```

### Logout
​
When the `LOGOUT` mutation is called, the token is removed from local storage AND the token and user state are cleared.

```js
mutations: {
  LOGOUT(state) {
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
    state.token = '';
    state.user = {};
    axios.defaults.headers.common = {};
  }
}
```


## Solar System Geeks online store

In this project you'll build a Vue front-end to the Solar System Geeks online store. You'll integrate this work with the API that you developed for your Module 2 end-of-module project.

You may use the HTML and CSS from your Module 3 mid-module project, which built a smaller front-end for the Solar System Geeks store using vanilla JavaScript.

## Provided server

If you don't have a working version of the Module Two final project, you can use the one in the `server` folder of this starter project.

There's a script in the `database` folder to create and populate a database. It's the same script you ran for the Module Two final project, so if you created the database for that project, you won't need to create it again.

Run the Java application as it provides the API for the Vue front-end that you're about to construct.

### Review the API

You'll want to re-familiarize yourself with the API you created previously. One way to do this is with Postman request collection, located in the `postman` folder. Import that collection into Postman if it's not already there, and run each request to recall how the API serves data.
​
## Requirements

The product team has collected a list of requirements for you to implement. User stories provide details on who does what in the application. In addition to the user stories, [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-wireframing/) must also be created for the following pages:
* products page
* products detail
* shopping cart page

Use the descriptions in the wireframe section below to help guide your design.

### User stories

User stories reflect what a particular _actor_ can accomplish in the application. For this application, there are two possible actors:

* Anonymous user: a person who hasn't yet logged into the application.
* Authenticated user: a person who has registered with and logged into the application.

The following list of user stories describes the requirements for this application.

#### Registration and login

* As an anonymous user, I can register a new account.
  * This feature already exists—**you just need to style the registration page**.
* As an anonymous user, I can login using an existing username and password.
  * This feature already exists—**you just need to style the login page**.
* As an authenticated user, I can click "Logout" to logout of the application.
  * After logout, the system redirects me to the Login page.
  * This feature already exists.

#### Products page

* As an anonymous or authenticated user, I can visit the Products page to see all the products in the SSGeek online store.
  * Route `/` and route `/products` both access the Products page.
    * Note: you can redirect the `/` route to the `products` route
  * Clicking `Home` on the navigation bar also accesses the Products page.
* As an anonymous or authenticated user, on the Products page, I can view the product list as a tiled view or a table view, by clicking the appropriate icon.
* As an anonymous or authenticated user, on the Products page, I can type a search term into a Search edit box, and the page displays only the products whose name contains the search term (ignoring case).
* As an anonymous or authenticated user, from the Products page, I can click a product name to go to the Product Details page.
  * Route `/product/n` accesses the Product Details page for the product with id = n.
* **Only as an authenticated user**, from the Products page, I can click a "shopping cart" icon next to the product, and the application adds the product to my cart.
  * As an anonymous user, the "shopping cart" icon isn't shown.
  * When I click the icon, the application adds 1 unit of the item to my cart.
  * If the item is already in my cart, the application adds 1 to the quantity that's already there.
  * The application shows me a message, confirming that it added the item to my cart.

#### Product Details page

* As an anonymous or authenticated user, I can see the details of one product on the Product Details page.
  * Route `/product/n` accesses the Product Details page for the product with id = n.
* **Only as an authenticated user**, from the Product Details page, I can click a "shopping cart" button on the page, and the application adds the product to my cart.
  * As an anonymous user, the "shopping cart" button isn't shown.
  * When I click the button, the application adds 1 unit of the item to my cart.
  * If the item is already in my cart, the application adds 1 to the quantity that's already there.
  * The application shows me a message, confirming that it added the item to my cart.

#### Shopping Cart page

* As an authenticated user, I can click the "Cart" link on the navigation bar to visit my shopping cart.
  * Route `/cart` accesses my Shopping Cart page.
  * The Shopping Cart page displays the quantity, name, price and extended price (qty * price) of each item in my cart.
  * The Shopping Cart page also displays the subtotal, tax, and total value of the all items in my cart.
* As an authenticated user, from the Shopping Cart page, I can click a product name to go to the Product Details page.
* As an authenticated user, on the Shopping Cart page, I can click an "X" icon next to any item to remove that item from my cart.
  * This removes the item totally, regardless of the quantity that was in the cart.
  * The application recalculates the subtotal, tax, and total amounts and re-displays the cart.
* As an authenticated user, on the Shopping Cart page, I can click a "Clear Cart" button to remove all items from my cart.

### Wireframes

Wireframes give you the basic layout and operation of each page. Use the descriptions below to guide your wireframes.

#### Basic layout

The `header` must:
* Display a logo centered on the page
* Always display at the top of the viewport, regardless of the scroll position

If you have a company logo to use, you can use that. If not, you can insert a placeholder image from [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/). For example, to insert a JPEG image with dimensions 700 pixels by 200 pixels, you can include the following image element:

```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x200.jpg">
```

The `nav` must:
* Include the following links:
  * `Home` and `Cart`. `Home` takes the user to the product list, while `Cart` takes them to their personal shopping cart.
  * `Login/Logout` links. Show the appropriate link depending on whether the user is already logged in. Only one of these displays at any given time. These links go to the `login` and `logout` routes.
* Highlight the active link in the nav bar.

The `main` area must scroll if its content doesn't fit in the available space, while the `header` and `footer` remain in place.

The `footer` must:
* Contain copyright text
* Always display at the bottom of the viewport, regardless of the length of the main section
> *Tip*: You can copy/paste the copyright symbol from here—`©`—or put `&copy;` in your HTML to have the browser render it.

#### Products page

Rename `views/HomeView.vue` to `views/ProductsView.vue` and update the route in `router/index.js`. Run the application, login in, and view the ProductsView page. It contains some hints on how to show a "loading" spinner and how to display Font Awesome icons. You're not required to use these features, but they can enhance the user experience.

*Hint*: See [Currency formatting](#currency-formatting) in the Hints section for how to format numbers in JavaScript.

*Hint*: For more information on Font Awesome see [Font Awesome icons](#font-awesome-icons) in the Hints section.

The products page contains a search box where the user can type a search term and press **Enter** to start the search, or the user can type a search term and click the magnifying glass icon to perform the search. The search must be case-insensitive.

If the user isn't logged in, display a paragraph before the product listing that says, "Welcome. You may browse anonymously as much as you wish, but you must Login to add items to your shopping cart." Make the word "Login" in that message a hyperlink to the Login page.

The products page contains a way for the user to switch between viewing the products as a set of tiles or as rows in a table. Both views contain the name, SKU, and price of the product as well as a way to add the product to the cart. The tiled view contains the product image, while the table view does not. The Tile and Table icons in the HomeView starter code can be used for switching between views.

#### Product Details page

The Product Details page displays a single product along with the following:
* The product name
* The product SKU
* The product price in dollars
* The product description
* The product image
* A button to add the product to the cart

#### Shopping Cart page

The Shopping Cart page displays a table of all the products added to the cart as well as the subtotal, tax, and total amount (subtotal + tax) for all items. The table contains the following columns:
* Quantity (Qty)
* Product name (Product)
* Price for a single product (Price)
* Price per product multiplied by the quantity (Amount)

The cart page has a way to remove a product from the shopping cart table. The subtotal, tax, and total amounts should automatically update.

The cart page contains a button to clear the entire cart.

## Hints

### Currency formatting

To show the product's price in the proper format, you can use the `Intl.NumberFormat` object. `Intl.NumberFormat` accepts `locale` and `options` as arguments. `locale` specifies the region whose formatting rules you want to use. `options` allows you to specify what type of formatting you want to apply to your number.

For example, to display a value in U.S. Dollars (USD):

```javascript
Intl.NumberFormat(`en-US`, {
        currency: `USD`,
        style: "currency",
    }).format(value);
```

For a more extensive description of the capabilities of `Intl.NumberFormat`, check out [Mozilla's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

### Font Awesome icons

**Font Awesome** is an open source provider of icons, many of which you can use for free.

If you recall, the mid-module project had the Font Awesome library imported with a `<link>` tag. While you can still use that method with a Vue application, there are also `npm` packages that provide Font Awesome icons.

This project has packages from `fortawesome`—that's not a typo, it's an open source fork of the Font Awesome library. The usage is very similar, instead of `<i>` tags you use `<font-awesome-icon>`.

Previously, you'd use this code to display a heart icon:

```html
<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
```

The equivalent code with the `font-awesome-icon` component is:

```html
<font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" />
```

Notice that the values you used for the `class` attribute are now used for the component's `icon` prop.

You can still use the `class` attribute to provide CSS styling. For example, assume you've created an `action-button` class that you want to add to the icon:

```html
<font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" class="action-button" />
```

You can find other examples of `<font-awesome-icon>` in the starting code of this project, and the Module 3 Sample Application.

Note that you must import and add icons in `src/main.js`. There you'll see these lines:

```js
import { faCartPlus, faTrashCan, faXmark, faMagnifyingGlass, faRotate, faTable, faGrip }
  from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

library.add(faCartPlus);
library.add(faTrashCan);
// ...
```

To add the heart icon, add `faHeart` to the import:

```js
import { faCartPlus, faTrashCan, faXmark, faMagnifyingGlass, faRotate, faTable, faGrip, faHeart }
  from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
```

And add it to the `library`:

```js
library.add(faCartPlus);
library.add(faTrashCan);
// ...
library.add(faHeart);
```

You can use the [Font Awesome icon search](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&o=r) or the [Fort Awesome icon browser](https://fortawesome.com/sets/starter) for icons.

### About favicon

A "favicon" is the small icon that you see on the browser tab when you navigate to a web page or application. When Vue creates a starter project for you, it supplies the familiar Vue "V" icon as your application's favicon. When you run this project, you'll see a different icon—one for the SS Geeks online store. It may interest you how to do this in your own project.

* First you need a very small picture (the SS Geeks favicon is 48 by 48 pixels) in the format of a `.ico` file. There are tools online for creating a `.ico` from a `.jpg` or `.png`.
* In your project, drop the file into the `/public` folder. In this project, the file is `/public/favicon-alien.ico`.
* In `index.html`, in the `<head>` section, add a `link` to the icon file:

```html
<head>
  ... other stuff, like meta tags and title
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon-alien.ico"> <!-- you don't need to include `public`, Vue automatically copies files from `public` to the root of the web server -->
</head>
```
