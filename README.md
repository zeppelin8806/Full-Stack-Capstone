# Final Full-Stack Capstone Project

This full-stack project is the culmination of my time at Tech Elevator's tech boot camp.

I developed a full-stack web application using Java, Spring Boot, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to
streamline project management tasks. Architected the applicationâ€™s design, and developed RESTful APIs for seamless client-server
communication, and ensured responsive UI/UX and efficient server-side logic. Conducted extensive unit and integration testing
to perform debugging tasks and ensure code reliability and performance.
